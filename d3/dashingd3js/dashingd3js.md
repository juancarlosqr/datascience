### The Data Visualization Process

- Acquire
  - Obtain the data, whether from a file on a disk or a source over a network.
- Parse
  - Provide some structure for the data's meaning, and order it into categories.
- Filter
  - Remove all but the data of interest.
- Mine
  - Apply methods from statistics or data mining as a way to discern patterns or place the data in mathematical context.
- Represent
  - Choose a basic visual model, such as a bar graph, list, or tree.
- Refine
  - Improve the basic representation to make it clearer and more visually engaging.
- Interact
  - Add methods for manipulating the data or controlling what features are visible.

__SVG__

SVG comes with a basic set of shape elements:

- Rectangle
- Circle
- Ellipse
- Straight Line
- Polyline
- Polygon

### D3 Virtual Selections ###

> The D3.js Data Operator returns three virtual selections rather than just the regular one like other methods.

The three virtual selections are enter, update and exit.

- The enter selection contains placeholders for any missing elements.
- The update selection contains existing elements, bound to data.
- Any remaining elements end up in the exit selection for removal.
